# About XranDream

XranDream is a GUI front-end for XrandR that allows you to create virtual displays for screen sharing parts of your
desktop with others. It gives you several presets to choose from as well as the ability to select a custom region within
your desktop to share. These virtual displays will show up like any other regular "full screen" option when prompted for
your screen sharing settings in apps such as Teams, Zoom, WebEx, etc.

# System Requirements

XranDream is only compatible with Linux and requires an X11 server to operate correctly with xrandr and PySides2
installed. No other dependencies are required.

# Installation

sudo apt install -y x11-xserver-utils python3-pyside2.{qtgui,qtwidgets,qtcore,qtuitools}
